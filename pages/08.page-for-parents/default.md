**Steps When Your Child Joins**

One of the things that we pride ourselves on in Delta Upsilon is building better men by teaching our four founding principles to our new members. We begin their introduction to our chapter by inviting them to participate in our weekly meetings. The moment they accept our invite they have the same amount of power in decision making as anyone else in the chapter. They start out as associate members and take a class after each meeting to learn about about Delta Upsilon. This includes both local and national history, how the chapter operates, and what it means to live by the four founding principles. Once completing the class they are full-fledged members. Being a member of Delta Upsilon helps your son to become a well rounded individual ready for life after college. We have made a commitment to manage school and fraternity life to succeed. A simple requirement that we stress is being a part of the community. We as volunteer ten hours individually, often as groups.

**Benefits**

There are many benefits that you get when joining our fraternity. We aren’t the largest organization on campus, so our bond with each other is a lot greater than many. We are a family that helps each other out. No one in our fraternity is afraid to ask for help from a fellow member. We also maintain a close relationship with our alumni organization. This allows your son to get connections for when he graduates college, and learn skills from those with experience. Once a year we celebrate Founder’s Day, a time where we get together with our alumni to have a meal and talk about anything.

In addition to the social benefits, Being in Delta Upsilon gives your son an opportunity to gain valuable leadership and organizational skills. There are nine executive positions within the chapter with many positions under them. Each position is specialized toward a different aspect of running an organization, from managing the chapter's finances to putting together events and marketing them, to meeting with other fraternities and sororities to discuss how to improve. The very website your are reading right now is written, developed, and managed entirely by undergraduate students in the chapter.
