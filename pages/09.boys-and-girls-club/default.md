title: 'The Boys and Girls Club'

Our chapter proudly supports the Boys and Girls Club of the Red River Valley through our annual Teeter-a-thon philanthropy event. We have been donating to their cause for more than five years and are planning to keep working to help them make a difference. For those who do not know of the Boy and Girls Club, their description is best given from their website:

“The Boys & Girls Club provides a place for youth to be with constructive things to do while not in school. We help youth develop the attitudes, skills, values and behaviors to succeed in life. Youth Development Strategies, based on basic principles, are designed to build self-esteem and allow our youth to grow into responsible and caring adults. These strategies are tools that will allow our youth to become responsible citizens and leaders who are able to lead successful lives.”

One hundred percent of donations received during Teeter-a-thon goes towards supporting this noble cause. If you would like to make a donation please stop by the Delta Upsilon house during Teeter-a-thon, or donate to the club directly through their website.
