Delta Upsilon was founded on November 4, 1834 at Williams College, Massachusetts and was the first non-secret fraternity. To us, non-secrecy means keeping our inner workings as an organization public and open to scrutiny, so that we may be held responsible for all of our actions..

Beginning with the first chapter of 30 men at Williams College, Delta Upsilon has grown to 4,000 undergraduate members across more than 90 chapters in both the United States and Canada. Notable among these members are US president James Garfield, Author Kurt Vonnegut, and the current president of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos.

The goal of Delta Upsilon is to help its members improve. As such, our mission statement is “Building better men” and to guide us in achieving this, we follow our four founding principles:
Development of Character
Advancement of Justice
Promotion of Friendship
The Advancement of Justice

Our local chapter of NDSU was founded in 1970 and over the years has maintained a strong presence in campus life. This presence includes us having the longest running annual philanthropy event in NDSU Greek Life, Teeter-a-thon. In this event, our brothers  teeter totter for 140 hours straight to raise money to the Boys and Girls Club of the Red River Valley.
