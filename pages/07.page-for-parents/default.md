**Parental Concerns**

We understand as a fraternity that you may have some concerns about your son joining our fraternity. The media has portrayed us as not an ideal place for college success. This will hopefully address some of the issues you may have with fraternities.

**Steps When Your Child Joins**

One of the things that we as Delta Upsilon pride ourselves on is building better men by instilling our four founding principles and ideals in our new members. We begin their introduction to our chapter by inviting them and participating in our weekly meetings. The moment they accept our invite they have the same amount of power in decision making as anyone else in the chapter. They start out as associates and take a class after each meeting to learn about what Delta Upsilon stands for. Once completing the class requirements they are full fledged members. Being a member of Delta Upsilon helps your son to become a well rounded individuals ready for life after college. We have made a commitment to manage school and fraternity life to succeed. A simple requirement that we stress is being a part of the community. We as a chapter have to volunteer ten hours individually.

**Benefits**

There are many benefits that you get when joining our fraternity. We aren’t the largest of the ones on campus, so our bond with each other is a lot greater than the rest. We are a family that helps each other out. No one in our fraternity is afraid to ask for help from a fellow member. Beyond the fact that we are small it helps us bond with our fellow alumni. Doing this allows your son to get connections for when he does successfully graduate college to already know some people that may help him get a job. On our Founder’s Day we get together with our alumni to have a meal and talk about anything.
