![](initiation.jpg?classes=wrap-image-left)**The North Dakota State Chapter of Delta Upsilon** has been promoting its highest standards of conduct since its colonization in 1970 here in Fargo. Our fraternity motto, 'Dikaia uputhuke' - justice our foundation, is the first milestone of the journey we take towards fulfilling our mission statement, Building Better Men. We achieve this by  following our four founding principles:

    <tr><td style="padding-right: 20px;">The Development of Character</td><td>The Promotion of Friendship</td></tr>
    <tr><td style="padding-right: 20px;">The Diffusion of Liberal Culture</td><td>The Advancement of Justice</td></tr>
</table>

Delta Upsilon, _the_ Non-secret fraternity, firmly believes in the idea of non secrecy. Founded upon the ideals of anti-secrecy we humbly reject all forms of secrecy, manipulation, and hazing that would harm ourselves or anyone else in any way. Instead we keep our doors open; free for the public to observe and scrutinize. Through this we are always held to our own standards.

If you are interested in developing leadership skills, having a support group for academic and personal goals, and being dedicated to governing body then consider joining Delta Upsilon.
